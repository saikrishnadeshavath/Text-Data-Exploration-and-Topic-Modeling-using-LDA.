# Text-Data-Exploration-and-Topic-Modeling-using-LDA.
This project demonstrates a basic workflow for analyzing text data using Python. It includes steps for loading and preprocessing text data, and applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover underlying topics within the documents.
Data Analysis Key Findings : 
The dataset contains 10 rows, with each row representing a unique document.
The text preprocessing steps included converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and stop words, and lemmatization.
The gensim library was used to create a dictionary and corpus from the preprocessed text, which are necessary inputs for the LDA model.
An LDA model was trained to identify 3 topics from the text data.
Insights :
The top words for each topic provide a basis for interpreting the themes present in the documents. Further analysis could involve manually labeling these topics based on the words.
For a larger dataset, increasing the number of topics and iterations in the LDA model might yield more granular and accurate topic representations.
